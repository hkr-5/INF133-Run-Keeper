4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I worked on my own referencing a lot of online resources. I realized that my search feature was running so slow and laggy, so I searched online about the issue and found about debouncing in JavaScript.
Then I decided to implement it in my code. Now the search feature works nicely and smoothly.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Nothing special, but I apologize that my activities.js is pretty long and looks kind of messy. 
And I mentioned above, I implemented debouncing in my search feature sp it runs smoothly.
